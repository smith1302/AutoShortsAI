<a href="https://autoshorts.ai/">AutoShorts.ai</a> automatically creates, schedules, and posts Faceless videos for you, on auto-pilot. Each video is unique and customized to your topic.

It's like having a team of video editors and social media managers runing your channel, 24/7.

## Features 🏆

### Video Creation
Our AI writes your script, creates voiceovers, captions, background footage, and produces a viral-worthy video in a single click. Alternatively, you can provide your own script and our AI will produce a stunning video based on the contents.

### Auto-Posting
This is where our platform shines. Once you specify what kind of video you want, AutoShorts will create a new video every day and post it straight to your channel - completely on auto-pilot. This allows you to grow your channel effortlessly, even while you sleep!

## Frequently Asked Questions 🤔
**Are the videos unique?**
> Unlike other services that re-use the same video over and over, we create a new video for each series using generative AI. This means that each video is unique and will not be the same as any other video.

**How does AutoShorts.ai work?**
> AutoShorts uses generative AI to create a short, faceless video using your selected topic. Either choose one from a pre-defined list (such as Interesting History, Motivational, etc.), or enter a custom prompt. AutoShorts will then create a new video each day (or however often your plan specifies) and post it straight to your linked account. We call this a "Video Series", and it allows you to sit back while allowing you to grow your audience effortlessly.

**Is there a free trial?**
> When you register a free account, your first video will be created and auto-posted for free. If you need continuous videos or a more frequent posting schedule, you will need to change plans

**What if I don't want my video posted?**
> That's an option too! If you don't want your videos posted, you can simply opt to have your rendered videos emailed to you. Otherwise, you can link a YouTube or TikTok account.

**Can I edit the videos??**
> Absolutely! You will have a chance to preview and edit the video before it is scheduled to be posted. You can modify the script, title, caption, background music, and more!
